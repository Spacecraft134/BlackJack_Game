# Introduction
Blackjack is a widely played gambling card game where players aim to achieve a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. Players start with two cards, and they can choose to hit (draw an additional card) or stand (keep their current hand). Players can hit multiple times, but going over 21 results in a bust, leading to an automatic loss.

The dealer plays last, following strict rules: they must stand on a hand value of 17 or higher and will continue to hit otherwise.

The outcome is determined as follows:

Players who bust lose their bets.
Among remaining players, the one with the hand closest to 21 wins.
If all players bust or all have the same hand total, the game results in a tie.
Face cards (Jacks, Queens, Kings) are valued at 10, and Aces can be worth either 1 or 11; for this program, Aces will consistently count as 11.
